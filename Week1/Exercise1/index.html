            Thomas John Watson Sr. was an American business executive who served as the chairman and CEO of Internation Business Machines Company (IBM). He was a pioneer in the development of accounting and computing equipments used today. He was born on February 17, 1874 to Thomas and Jane Fulton White Watson in Campbell, New York. He attended the Addison Academy but turned down his father's offer to pay his college expenses. Instead, he took a short course in the Elmira School of Commerce and became a salesman in Painted Post, N.Y. Then, he took on a bunch of odd jobs and eventually worked his way up to general sales manager in National Cash Register Company. He finally assumed the management of IBM in 1924 and built it into one of the world's largest and most respected corporations. He was instrumental in both encouraging IBM's initial growth and making it an international company. He was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.
